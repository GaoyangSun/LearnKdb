Select
从一个table select几列时，不会对表进行复制。由于列是相邻的内存块，可以passed by reference
Where 从句从左往右读取，右边的条件在左边条件筛选剩下的列里面去选取，因此最严格的条件应该放在最左边
（，）和（and/or）的区别在于，and会把两个条件分别做筛选，然后取交集/并集
可以用venn图来将（or）转化为（，）
not(A or B) -> not(A), not(B),  (A or B) -> not(not(A), not(B))

select from t where (id=1) or date.month=2000.02m
-> delete from t where not id=1, not date.month=2000.02m

t: select date, symbol, close from stkDailyTrade1 where date.month = 2017.01m
"," 0: select close by symbol,date from t -> type error, because each price col is a list, not an atom

Exec 
select is a special form of exec,  -> (select symbol, date, close from t) ~ flip exec symbol,date,close from t
select only return tables, exec can return atom, list, dict or table
atom -> exec first close from t
list -> exec close from t
dict 
(exec symbol,date,close from t)`symbol
(exec px:close from t)`px
(exec last close by date from t where symbol = `000001)[2017.01.03]
(exec px: last close by symbol, date from t where symbol = `000001)[(`000001;2017.01.03)]
(exec close by date:date from t where symbol = `000001)[select date from t where symbol = `000001]
(exec close:close by date from t where symbol = `000001)[2017.01.03]

Exec by
(exec first ([] date; close) by symbol:symbol from t) ~ exec first date, first close by symbol:symbol from t
calling first on the table creates a dictionary. The by clause causes one dictionary to be created for each id, and the resulting list of dictionaries is then promoted to a table.
